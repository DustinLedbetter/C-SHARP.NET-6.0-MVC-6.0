--This project meets all goals provided.

X Important Notes:

   1. The DB scripts had User for a table name. This had to be changed to Users as ‘User’ is a keyword.

   2. The MVC has been getting away from allowing the program to close and moving more toward redirection, so my app redirects to home page or in instance of a failure        to login and locked site… my LinkedIn page

X Other Notes: 

   1. The questions can be chosen by user within a range of 10-50.

   2. There is a simple about and privacy page added.

   3. The Quiz page will highlight in green all answers the user got right and in red for all they got wrong.

   4. The Quiz page will also display all of the correct capitals as well and allow user 1 min to review them


X Final:

This project was a very fun and enjoyable learning refresher that allowed me to update and learn some new mechanics that were new as the languages have evolved. I have more I’d like to do, but this program is functioning and working.
